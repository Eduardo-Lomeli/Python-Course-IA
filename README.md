# Python-Course-IA
This repository contains all the scripts and exercises I have completed for the Python course from Programación Fácil, as part of my Artificial Intelligence class.

# About This Repository

The main purpose of this repository is to document my progress throughout the course and to serve as a personal reference for the concepts I've learned. Each script corresponds to a specific lesson or topic from the course curriculum.
